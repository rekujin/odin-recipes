    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      The best weeknight dinners have a short ingredient list, require minimal
      hands-on prep, and come together quickly at a time of day when my energy
      is fading. Did I mention that it helps when those dinners taste amazing
      too? Some of my favorite meals that check all of these boxes include
      creamy pepperoncini chicken skillet, one-pot Cajun pasta, and this recipe
      for harissa orange salmon patties.
    </p>
    <p>
      These patties start like most other salmon or tuna cakes, by binding fresh
      or canned salmon together with breadcrumbs and an egg. They’re seasoned
      with orange zest and harissa paste, then seared until golden-brown and
      finished with a sweet-and-spicy glaze made from honey, orange juice, and
      harissa paste. It’s so delicious and simple to make that it’s become a
      weekly staple in my kitchen. Once you try it, it might become one of your
      favorites too.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Finely grated zest from 1 medium orange (about 2 tablespoons)</li>
      <li>1 large egg</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons harissa paste, divided</li>
      <li>3/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
      <li>3 medium scallions</li>
      <li>
        2 tablespoons fresh cilantro leaves (8 sprigs), plus more for garnish
      </li>
      <li>1 pound skinless salmon fillets, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
      <li>2/3 cup panko breadcrumbs</li>
      <li>1/4 cup freshly squeezed orange juice (from 1 medium orange)</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons honey</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Whisk the finely grated zest from 1 medium orange, 1 large egg, 2
        tablespoons of the harissa paste, and 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt together
        in a large bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Coarsely chop the white parts of 3 medium scallions and add to a food
        processor. Finely chop the scallion greens and reserve for garnish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add 2 tablespoons fresh cilantro leaves to the food processor and pulse
        until the scallions are broken down into very small pieces, 4 to 6
        (1-second) pulses. Add 1 pound skinless salmon pieces and pulse until
        coarsely ground, 8 to 10 (1-second) pulses.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the salmon mixture and 2/3 cup panko breadcrumbs to the egg mixture.
        Gently fold together with a flexible spatula until combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        Divide the salmon mixture into 4 portions (about 3/4 cup or 5 ounces
        each). Form each one into a patty about 1 inch thick and 3 1/2 inches
        wide.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whisk 1/4 cup orange juice, 3 tablespoons honey, and the remaining 1
        tablespoon harissa paste together in a small bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large (12-inch) nonstick or cast iron
        skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Swirl so that the oil coats
        the bottom of the pan. Using a wide, flat spatula, gently transfer the
        patties to the pan and cook until golden-brown on the first side, 3 to 4
        minutes. Flip the patties and cook for 1 minute.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reduce the heat to medium-low and pour the sauce over the patties. Cook,
        spooning some of the sauce over the patties as they cook, until the
        sauce is thickened and the salmon is just cooked through, about 3
        minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the
        salmon patties should register at least 125°F. Garnish with the scallion
        greens and chopped fresh cilantro leaves if desired.
