    <h1>Yalancı Mantı (Turkish Pasta) Recipe</h1>
    <img src="../images/turkish-pasta.jpg" alt="Turkish Pasta" width="500" />

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Yalancı Mantı (also called Turkish pasta) means “fake dumplings.” It gets
      its name because the pasta is a shortcut version of Turkish mantı, a
      delicious time-consuming dumpling dish filled with spiced meat and
      finished with a Turkish pepper sauce and garlicky yogurt. The cheat
      version employs pasta and quickly sautéed beef or lamb to avoid the
      tedious task of forming and folding dumplings. It’s also called Kıymalı
      Makarna, which means “minced meat pasta.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I tried several different versions before landing on my ideal dish. To
      break down what goes into Yalancı Mantı, the bowl starts with some
      undressed short pasta. Top that with a generous dollop of Greek yogurt
      mixed with lemon and garlic. Then you spoon over spiced beef or lamb that
      you’ve cooked with onions and Turkish pepper paste until deeply browned
      and crispy in spots. Drizzle that with some paprika butter, and top with
      fresh cherry tomatoes, chopped parsley, and a little dried mint.

      <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1/4 cup water</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) unsalted butter</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Turkish red pepper paste or tomato paste</li>
      <li>A pinch of kosher salt</li>
      <li>2 cups plain Greek yogurt</li>
      <li>4 cloves garlic, minced or finely grated</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice (from 1 medium lemon)</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
      <li>1 cup cherry or grape tomatoes, halved</li>
      <li>
        1/2 cup finely chopped fresh parsley leaves (from 1/2 medium bunch)
      </li>
      <li>Dried mint, for garnish (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Add 1 pound
        dried farfalle pasta to the boiling water and cook according to package
        directions until al dente. Drain and set aside. Meanwhile, make the
        spiced beef, paprika butter, and yogurt sauce.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add 1 pound lean ground beef and
        cook, breaking it up into very smaller pieces, until no longer pink,
        about 4 minutes. Stir in 1 medium finely diced yellow onion, 2
        tablespoons red pepper paste, 2 teaspoons paprika, 1 teaspoon garlic
        powder, 1 teaspoon ground cumin, 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt, and 1/4
        teaspoon black pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the beef is
        deeply browned and crispy in spots, 7 to 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the pan from the heat. Stir in 1/4 cup water and scrape up any
        browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Taste and season with kosher
        salt as needed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Melt 4 tablespoons unsalted butter in a small saucepan over medium heat.
        Stir in 1 teaspoon paprika, 1 teaspoon red pepper paste, and 1 pinch
        kosher salt. Cook, stirring constantly, until bubbling and fragrant,
        about 1 minute. Remove the saucepan from the heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir 2 cups plain Greek yogurt, 4 minced garlic cloves, 2 tablespoons
        lemon juice, and 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt together in a medium bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Divide the pasta into 6 individual bowls. Divide the yogurt mixture over
        the pasta (about 1/3 cup each). Using a slotted spoon, divide the ground
        beef mixture over the yogurt (about 1/4 cup each). Drizzle with the
        paprika butter (about 2 teaspoons each). Garnish with 1 cup halved
        cherry tomatoes and 1/2 cup finely chopped fresh parsley leaves.
        Sprinkle with dried mint if desired.
      </li>
    </ol>
