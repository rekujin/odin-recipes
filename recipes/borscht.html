    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Borscht is the perfect cold-weather soup — it’s rich, earthy, and has just
      the right amount of sour. I love borscht’s deep ruby-red color,
      rib-sticking heartiness, and the fact that it’s full of vegetables, which
      feels like a win come wintertime.
    </p>
    <p>
      Borscht is endlessly riffable. Plus, it’s a great way to use up the
      vegetables you have on hand. Because the beets and red cabbage will stain
      any other vegetables you add a bright red, they’ll end up blending in
      seamlessly (just watch out for your shirt and kitchen towels!). So if your
      memories of borscht consist of the sickly sweet jarred variety, you owe it
      to yourself to give the homemade variety a chance.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 large yellow onion</li>
      <li>1 pound boneless beef chuck roast or stew meat</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt, divided, plus more as needed</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
      <li>1 (6-ounce) can tomato paste</li>
      <li>
        2 (32-ounce) cartons low-sodium vegetable or chicken broth (about 8
        cups)
      </li>
      <li>2 dried bay leaves</li>
      <li>1 1/4 pounds loose red beets (about 3 large)</li>
      <li>3 medium carrots (about 10 ounces)</li>
      <li>1 large russet potato (about 8 ounces)</li>
      <li>1/2 small red cabbage (about 1 pound)</li>
      <li>1/4 cup red wine vinegar</li>
      <li>1/4 cup packed light brown sugar</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven and heat the oven to 400ºF.
        Halve and thinly slice 1 large yellow onion (about 2 cups). Trim off any
        large pieces of fat from 1 pound boneless beef chuck roast, then cut
        into rough 1-inch pieces (no need to cut stew meat). Season the beef
        with 1 teaspoon of the kosher salt.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over
        medium-high heat until shimmering. Add the beef in a single layer and
        sear until browned all over, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer to a
        plate.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reduce the heat to medium. Add the onion and cook, scraping up the brown
        bits from the bottom of the pot with a wooden spoon, until golden brown
        and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add 1 (6-ounce) can tomato paste and
        cook, stirring occasionally, until the tomato paste is slightly
        darkened, 2 to 4 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Return the beef and any accumulated juices to the pot. Add 2 (32-ounce)
        cartons low-sodium vegetable or chicken broth and 2 dried bay leaves.
        Scrape the bottom of the pot to loosen any browned bits, increase heat
        to high, and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to maintain a simmer.
        Simmer until the beef is tender, about 1 hour.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, peel and cut 1 1/4 pounds loose red beets into 3/4-inch
        pieces (about 3 1/2 cups). Peel and dice 3 medium carrots (about 1 1/2
        cups). Peel and dice 1 large russet potato (about 1 1/2 cups). Place on
        a rimmed baking sheet. Drizzle with the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil
        and season with the remaining 1 teaspoon kosher salt. Toss to combine
        and spread into an even layer. Roast until crisp-tender and browned in
        spots, about 30 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Prepare the cabbage and toppings while the vegetables are roasting: Cut
        the core from 1/2 small red cabbage, then thinly slice (about 3 cups).
        Coarsely chop the leaves and tender stems from 1/2 medium bunch fresh
        dill. Dice 1/2 medium English cucumber if desired. Add 1 tablespoon
        prepared horseradish and 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt to 1 (8-ounce)
        container sour cream and stir to combine if desired.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the roasted vegetables, cabbage, 1/4 cup red wine vinegar, and 1/4
        cup packed light brown sugar to the pot and stir to combine. Simmer
        until the cabbage is tender and everything is bright red, about 15
        minutes. Discard the bay leaves. Taste and season with more kosher salt
        as needed. Top each serving with the cucumber, dill, and a dollop of the
        horseradish sour cream if desired.
